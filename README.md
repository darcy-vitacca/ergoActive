ErgoActive is a chrome extension that gives you intervals to help you move at your desk to prevent health issues. The timer allows users to fully customize their intervals they want to spend between sitting, standing, being active and drinking water while at a desk. It has a timer running in the background script of the browser which communicates to the front end after itâ€™s started, and persists when closed. When the user sets preferences in the frontend modal they are stored in the browser so their preferences are always remembered on opening of the browser.
